# My Forage

My code and notes are made while going through virtual internships on The Forage.

## How will this work?

Since I will need to fork the company provided repos to work with, this repo will hold notes about what I learned during said projects and links to their repos.

## Job simulations

### JP Morgan Chase

#### Software Engineering Lite

During this job simulation I worked on modifying an existing system using Java. I modified unit tests and created a new class to meet user requirements.
